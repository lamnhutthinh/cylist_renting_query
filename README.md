# Cylist renting query
This is a guide project from Google Data Analytics Course on Coursera. 12 datasets of cyclist renting information in 12 consecutive months are provided with approximately 5 millions records in total. I decided to concatenate them all together using Python, then the final dataset was imported in SQL server.
